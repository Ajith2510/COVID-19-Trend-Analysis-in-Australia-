This project analyzes COVID-19 case trends and mortality rates across five Australian states using real-time data sourced from COVID Live (https://covidlive.com.au/). The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Key insights cover case surges, mortality trends, population-normalized infection rates, and correlations between new cases and deaths. Interactive visualizations such as boxplots, line charts, and scatter plots provide a clear understanding of pandemic patterns across different states.
